## 4. Severity Assessment

- **High Severity:**
  - Leakage at Parking Area ceiling and cracks on External wall (near Master Bedroom) are flagged as high risk due to potential impact on durability and safety if unaddressed.
- **Medium Severity:**
  - Moisture indicators (dampness, efflorescence) and finish defects (tile joint gaps) are medium risk, as they may worsen and require remediation.
- **Reasoning:** Severity is based on the provided rules: active leakage/cracks are high, moisture/finish defects are medium.

---

## 5. Probable Root Cause (Hypotheses)

**Hypothesis 1:** Bathroom waterproofing / tile joint failure allowing moisture ingress  
- **Confidence:** Medium  
- **Evidence Basis:**  
  - Presence of tile joint gaps in bathroom areas  
  - Multiple moisture indicators observed in bathrooms

**Hypothesis 2:** Localized plumbing leakage contributing to moisture presence  
- **Confidence:** Medium  
- **Evidence Basis:**  
  - Inspection mentions plumbing-related issues  
  - Leakage-related observations present

**Hypothesis 3:** External seepage through cracks or building envelope defects  
- **Confidence:** Low  
- **Evidence Basis:**  
  - External wall cracks are reported  
  - Efflorescence/dampness consistent with moisture migration

---

## 6. Recommended Actions

### Immediate
- Investigate and repair the active leakage source immediately to prevent further damage.
- Conduct structural assessment of reported cracks and carry out appropriate repair/remediation.

### Short-term
- Address dampness/efflorescence areas after identifying the moisture pathway; repair finishes after source control.
- Re-grout and seal tile joints in affected wet areas to reduce water ingress.
- Inspect plumbing lines and fittings in affected bathrooms; repair any defects found.

### Verification
- Perform moisture meter readings at affected walls (skirting zones, bathrooms, adjacent rooms) to quantify moisture extent.
- If plumbing leakage is suspected, perform a plumbing pressure test to confirm.
- Repeat thermal scan post-repair to confirm anomaly reduction (room-level mapping recommended).

## 7. Additional Notes

- **Thermal Notes:**  
  - Maximum hotspot: 28.8°C  
  - Minimum coldspot: 20.1°C  
  - Temperature difference: 8.7°C  
  - Interpretation: Moderate thermal variation, may be normal depending on environment and application.
  - Mapping confidence: High, but room-level mapping is Not Available.

- **Limitations:**  
  - Room-level mapping of thermal images is Not Available unless explicitly provided.
  - No confirmation via moisture meter or invasive testing.

---

## 8. Missing or Unclear Information

- Room-level mapping of thermal images to specific inspected areas is Not Available.
- Exact source of moisture (plumbing vs seepage vs condensation) is Not Available.
- Depth and extent of moisture penetration is Not Available.
- Confirmation via moisture meter or invasive testing is Not Available.
- Construction details of walls, slabs, and waterproofing systems are Not Available.
- Timing alignment between inspection observations and thermal imaging is Not Available.

---

## 9. Consistency / Conflict Check

- Thermal data shows significant temperature variation, which is generally consistent with the moisture-related issues observed in the inspection report.
- Room-level correlation is Not Available due to missing thermal image mapping.
